This Terraform template configures an Azure Application Gateway with a Web Application Firewall (WAF) that uses the OWASP rules and a custom rule.

1. The provider block sets up the Azure provider with the required features.
2. The azurerm_resource_group resource creates a resource group named "example-resources" in the "West Europe" location.
3. The azurerm_virtual_network resource creates a virtual network named "example-network" with an address space of "10.0.0.0/16".
4. The azurerm_subnet resource creates a subnet named "example-subnet" with an address prefix of "10.0.1.0/24".
5. The azurerm_public_ip resource creates a public IP address named "example-publicip" with a dynamic allocation method.
6. The azurerm_application_gateway resource creates an Application Gateway named "example-gateway" with a WAF_v2 SKU, a gateway IP configuration, a frontend port, a frontend IP configuration, a backend address pool, backend HTTP settings, an HTTP listener, and a request routing rule. It also sets up the WAF configuration to use the custom Web Application Firewall policy defined in the azurerm_web_application_firewall_policy resource.
7. The azurerm_web_application_firewall_policy resource creates a custom WAF policy named "example-waf-policy" with a custom rule that blocks requests from the IP range "192.168.1.0/24". It also configures the policy to use the OWASP rules with version 3.1.

To add more custom rules, follow these steps:

1. In the azurerm_web_application_firewall_policy resource, create a new custom_rule block.
2. Assign a unique name and priority to the new rule. Ensure that the priority is unique across all rules in the policy.
3. Configure the rule_type as "MatchRule".
4. Define the match_conditions block with the desired conditions for the rule. You can use various match_variable options, such as "RemoteAddr", "RequestMethod", "QueryString", "PostArgs", "RequestHeader", and more. Consult the official Terraform documentation for more information on the available match variables and operators.
5. Set up the action for the new rule, either "Allow", "Block", or "Log".

Remember to adjust the configuration according to your requirements, and to use unique priority values for each rule in the Web Application Firewall policy.
