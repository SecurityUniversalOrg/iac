Azure, AWS, and GCP each offer a Web Application Firewall (WAF) solution that can be compared to those provided by Akamai or Cloudflare. While each of these cloud providers has its own unique features and pricing models, their WAF solutions generally offer similar functionality to protect web applications from common threats and vulnerabilities.

1. **Azure**: Azure Application Gateway WAF is a web application firewall solution provided by Microsoft Azure. It protects web applications from common web vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and other OWASP top 10 threats. Azure WAF can be integrated with Azure Application Gateway or Azure Front Door, allowing you to build a secure and scalable web application environment.

2. **AWS**: AWS WAF is a web application firewall solution provided by Amazon Web Services. It allows you to create custom security rules to block common web exploits such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and other OWASP top 10 threats. AWS WAF can be integrated with Amazon CloudFront, AWS Application Load Balancer, and AWS API Gateway, giving you a range of options for securing your web applications.

3. **GCP**: Google Cloud Armor is a web application firewall solution provided by Google Cloud Platform. It protects web applications from common web vulnerabilities and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Google Cloud Armor can be integrated with Google Cloud Load Balancing, allowing you to build a secure and scalable web application environment.

While these WAF solutions can be compared to those offered by Akamai and Cloudflare, it's essential to evaluate them based on your specific requirements, such as performance, ease of use, integration with other services, and pricing, to determine the best fit for your use case.
