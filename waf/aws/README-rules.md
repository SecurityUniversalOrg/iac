This Terraform template configures an AWS WAF v2 WebACL with a mix of managed OWASP rules and custom rules.

1. The provider block sets up the AWS provider with the "us-west-2" region.
2. The aws_wafv2_web_acl resource creates a WebACL named "example-web-acl" with a description and "REGIONAL" scope.
3. The default_action block sets the default action to "allow" for any requests that don't match any of the defined rules.
4. The first rule block sets up the "aws-managed-owasp-rule" rule that has a priority of 0. This rule uses the "AWSManagedRulesCommonRuleSet" managed rule group from AWS, which includes a set of AWS-provided rules that provide coverage against the OWASP Top 10 web application risks. The action for this rule is set to "block".
5. The second rule block sets up a custom rule named "custom-rule" with a priority of 1. This rule uses an or_statement with a byte_match_statement to block requests containing the string "example-bad-string" in the URI path. The action for this rule is set to "block".
6. The visibility_config blocks in each rule disable CloudWatch metrics and sampled requests. To enable them, set cloudwatch_metrics_enabled and sampled_requests_enabled to true.

To add more custom rules, follow these steps:

1. Create a new rule block in the aws_wafv2_web_acl resource.
2. Assign a unique name and priority to the new rule. Ensure that the priority is unique across all rules in the WebACL.
3. Configure the action (either "allow", "block", or "count") for the rule.
4. Define the statement to match the desired conditions for the rule. You can use various statements, such as geo_match_statement, ip_set_reference_statement, rate_based_statement, and more. Consult the official Terraform documentation for more information on the available statements.
5. Set up the visibility_config for the new rule, enabling or disabling CloudWatch metrics and sampled requests as needed.

Remember to adjust the configuration according to your requirements, and to use unique priority values for each rule in the WebACL.
