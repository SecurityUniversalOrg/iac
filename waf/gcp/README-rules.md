This Terraform template configures a Google Cloud Armor security policy with a mix of OWASP rules and custom rules.

1. The provider block sets up the Google Cloud provider with the specified project ID and "us-central1" region. Replace "your-project-id" with your actual Google Cloud project ID.
2. The google_compute_security_policy resource creates a security policy named "example-security-policy".
3. The first rule block sets up the default "allow" rule with the highest priority (2147483647). This rule allows all requests by matching any source IP range.
4. The second rule block sets up the "OWASP XSS rule" with a priority of 1000. This rule uses the evaluatePreconfiguredExpr function to apply the preconfigured Cloud Armor XSS rule. The action for this rule is set to "deny(403)", which means any request matching this rule will be blocked with a 403 response.
5. The third rule block sets up the "OWASP SQLi rule" with a priority of 2000. This rule uses the evaluatePreconfiguredExpr function to apply the preconfigured Cloud Armor SQLi rule. The action for this rule is set to "deny(403)".
6. The fourth rule block sets up a custom rule named "Custom rule to block requests from IP range 192.168.1.0/24" with a priority of 3000. This rule uses the inIpRange function to block requests coming from the specified IP range. The action for this rule is set to "deny(403)".

To add more custom rules, follow these steps:

1. Create a new rule block in the google_compute_security_policy resource.
2. Assign a unique name and priority to the new rule. Ensure that the priority is unique across all rules in the security policy.
3. Configure the action (either "allow", "deny", or "deny(status_code)") for the rule.
4. Define the match block with the desired conditions for the rule. You can use the versioned_expr field with the value "CUSTOM_EXPR" and define your own expressions using the config block. Consult the official documentation for more information on the available functions and expressions.
5. Optionally, add a description for the new rule.

Remember to adjust the configuration according to your requirements, and to use unique priority values for each rule in the security policy.
